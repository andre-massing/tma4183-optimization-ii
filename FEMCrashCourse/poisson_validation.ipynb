The second positional argument contains information about the type of FE interpolation (the reference FE in this case). With `ReferenceFE(lagrangian,Float64,order)` We select a scalar-valued Lagrangian reference FE of order 1, where the value of the shape functions will be represented with  64-bit floating point numbers. With the key-word argument `conformity` we define the regularity of the interpolation at the boundaries of the cells in the mesh. Here, we use `conformity=:H1`, which means that the resulting interpolation space is a subset of $H^1(\\Omega)$ (i.e., continuous shape functions). On the other hand, we pass the identifiers of the Dirichlet boundary via the `dirichlet_tags` argument. In this case, we mark as Dirichlet all objects of the discrete model identified with the `\"boundary\"` tag.
